# 📓 Lab 3: Multi-Stage Build

Multi-Stage builds are useful where one stage can be used for compilation, and
the resulting binary can be copied to a light and final environment, allowing a
slimmer image without any of the development stack.

This can be done adjusting a definition file by adding the Stage keyword to the
header section, lets create a lab3.def file:

```bash
$ vi lab3.def
````

Copy and paste the contents of this file into the terminal:

```bash
Bootstrap: docker
From: golang:1.20.2-alpine
Stage: compiler

%post
  git clone https://github.com/golang/example
  cd example/hello
  go build

Bootstrap: docker
From: alpine:3.17
Stage: final

%files from compiler
  /root/hello /bin/hello
```

```bash
$ sudo singularity build lab3.sif lab3.def

The names of the stages are up to you, and each of the sections will be executed
in the same order as described. Note that if you re-arrange the order of the
above stages will result in an error, create a file named lab3-wrong.def and try
to build it.

```bash
$ vi lab3-wrong.def

Bootstrap: docker
From: alpine:3.17
Stage: final

%files from compiler
  /root/hello /bin/hello

Bootstrap: docker
From: golang:1.20.2-alpine
Stage: compiler

%post
  git clone https://github.com/golang/example
  cd example/hello
  go build
```

```bash
$ sudo singularity build lab3-wrong.sif lab3-wrong.def 

INFO:    Starting build...

INFO:    Copying /root/hello to /bin/hello
FATAL:   While performing build: unable to copy files from stage to container fs: no source files found matching: /root/hello
```

The “final” stage cannot get the files from the “compiler” stage because they do
not exist.
